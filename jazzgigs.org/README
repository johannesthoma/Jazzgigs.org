Jazzgigs.org readme
===================

Jazzgigs.org is a web-based platform for publishing public events
(such as jazz concerts). It is written in the MVC framework
Ruby on Rails and licensed under the GNU general public license
(GPL). It was written by Johannes Thoma (johannes.thoma@gmx.at)

To obtain jazzgigs.org source code point your browser to 
www.github.com, search for jazzgigs.org and follow the instructions.
As of this writing, the only way to access the source code
is via git at github. Do a

git clone git@github.com:johannesthoma/jazzgigs.org.git

to download the sources.

Installing jazzgigs.org requires a webserver (such as apache),
a rails plugin (such as passenger aka mod_rails), a database 
(such as mysql) and the application itself.

Here is an incomplete list of installation steps:

.) I recommend using rvm, this is to have a separate ruby and a
separate gemset for each application. See www.beginrescueend.com
for details.

.) I also use bundle, to install the gems do the following:

gem install bundler
bundle install

.) Copy the file config/database.yml.jazzgigs to config/database.yml.

.) Edit the file config/database.yml to match your database 
connection.

For mysql, create a user, a database and allow user access to 
database:

bash$ mysql 
mysql> create user 'jazzgigs'@'localhost' identified by 'jazzgigs';
mysql> create database jazzgigs;
mysql> grant all on jazzgigs.* to jazzgigs@localhost;

.) rake db:migrate

TODO: rake db:schema:load?

I would like to encourage everyone who uses jazzgigs.org to 
send me a feedback email to johannes.thoma@gmx.at, thank you!

- Johannes
